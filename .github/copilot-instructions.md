# Rules - !!IMPORTANT!!

When you are in Agent mode, do the edits for me, don't tell me what to do. (Sometimes editing is not fitting in the situation or there are multiple alternatives, then don't edit.)
Never run commands in terminal to build or run developer server.
When i have edited someting in beatween promts, don't revert those changes.
This is for a production website!! (VERY IMPORTANT!!) Write everything proffessianaly. The UX should be very good.
Always use Nuxt UI components (only the up to date ones that exist). They start with U and then the normal name of the element. Use https://ui.nuxt.com/
Write comments for everything. Write readable code.
Use supabase like: "const supabase = useSupabaseClient();"
The facit is 170k rows and the intire table can not be fetched. So use useAsyncData and fetch only the plants needed.
Use Typescript and define types
You don't need to import to vue files as everything is auto-imported (some things still needs to be imported, like types, nothing else)
Use Nuxt 3 conventions (definePageMeta, useAsyncData, etc.)
Always use "useAsyncData" (very important for SSR and load times)
Use arrow functions.
Make everything SEO compatible. Use semantic html.
Make the site fast and responsive and utilize server side rendering. Performance is very important.
Always handle errors.
Look in project-info.md for information about the project and data structure.
Don't write in the code what changes have been made. Just write comments for the code and what it does.
Always use the variables for color. Never any own colours. The variables are found in main.css
The design should be modern and clean and well though out. A bit rounded. No exessive drop shadows. It should apeal for the averarage adult.
It needs to be mobile friedly and fully responsive.
